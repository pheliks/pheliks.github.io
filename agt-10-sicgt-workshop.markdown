Being the intersection of graph theory and computer science, Algorithmic Graph Theory is the study of graph-theoretical problems from a computational perspective. The goal of the Algorithmic Graph Theory minisymposium at the <a target="_blank" href="https://sicgt.si/">10th Slovenian Conference on Graph Theory</a> is to present the spectrum of current research in the area, highlighting relevant open problems and possible techniques for solving them. The topics of interest include (but are not limited to): structural graph theory, graph classes, width parameters, algorithmic metatheorems, parameterized complexity, and approximation algorithms.
