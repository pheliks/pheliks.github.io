Temporal graph theory is an emerging area motivated by the need of mathematical foundations for analysis of 
temporal networks arising from rich and rapidly growing domain of modern systems with dynamic interactions 
including Internet, mobile-phone networks, ecological networks, social networks, wireless ad hoc networks, 
transportation networks, etc.

The aims of this one-day workshop are:
* highlight and strengthen the links between temporal graph theory and other areas of mathematics and computer science;
* bring together interested academics from computer science, mathematics and other areas and stimulate cross-fertilizing discussion;
* foster an interest in the new exciting field and challenging problems in the participants, especially in postgraduate students and early career researchers.
